# Endpoint API

This PHP script serves as a basic API endpoint that retrieves query parameters, performs validations, and returns a JSON response with relevant information. It's designed to be accessed via a URL, and it provides information about a user's Slack name, the current day of the week, UTC time, and a specified track.

## Usage

1. Ensure the PHP script is hosted on a server with PHP support.
2. Access the script via a URL with the required query parameters.

Example:

```plaintext
https://yourdomain.com/path/to/index.php?slack_name=example&track=programming
```

## Query Parameters

- `slack_name`: The Slack name of the user.
- `track`: The specified track information.

## Response

The script returns a JSON response with the following information:

- `slack_name`: User's Slack name.
- `current_day`: Current day of the week.
- `utc_time`: Current UTC time.
- `track`: Specified track information.
- `github_file_url`: URL to view the script on GitHub.
- `github_repo_url`: URL to the GitHub repository.
- `status_code`: HTTP status code (200 for successful response, 400 for errors).
